Santa_with_db


Modified the [Santa_no_DB] project, adapted the five RESTful routes for Categories and Toys, and made them query the PostgreSQL database (with the help of the Sequelize ORM) instead of using the [categories] and [toys] variables.

Also added 3 more relations to the DB: [Elves, Wishes and Schedules]
